---

## Context

- Current code base: `src/`
- Dependency management: `package.json`
- Project background: `README.md`

## Your task

1. Review the current code base and understand its structure and functionality.
2. Evaluate the code quality, including readability, maintainability, security, and performance.
3. Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
4. Write a review report summarizing your findings, including:

## Output

- A detailed code review report, including:
  - Overview of the code base structure and functionality, keep it concise.
  - Evaluation of code quality, including readability, maintainability, security, and performance
  - Identification of potential issues, such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance bottlenecks
  - Recommendations for improvements, such as refactoring suggestions, security enhancements, or performance optimizations

Note:

- Keep the report professional and constructive, focusing on how to improve the code base rather than criticizing it.
- Be practical, don't over-engineer solutions or suggest unnecessary changes.
- Don't miss any important details.

Write your report in `docs/code-review.md`:

- if the file does not exist, create it
- if the file exists, delete the file and create a new one
