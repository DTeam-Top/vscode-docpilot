## Context

- Current code base: `src/`
- Dependency management: `package.json`
- Project background: `README.md`

## Your task

1. Explain the current code base to a new developer, providing a clear understanding of its structure and functionality.
2. Highlight key components, modules, and their interactions.
3. Draw a mermaid diagram to illustrate the architecture and flow of the application.
4. Write an explanation report including your findings.

## Output

- A detailed code explanation report, including:
  - Overview of the code base structure and functionality, keeping it concise.
  - Key components and modules, their roles, and how they interact.
  - A mermaid diagram illustrating the architecture and flow of the application.
  - Any other relevant information that would help a new developer understand the code base.

Note:

Write your report in `docs/code-explanation.md`:

- if the file does not exist, create it
- if the file exists, delete the file and create a new one
