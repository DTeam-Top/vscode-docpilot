# Current Task: Enhanced PDF Summarization with Advanced Chunking

## Task Overview

Enhance DocPilot's PDF summarization capabilities with intelligent chunking, semantic boundary preservation, and hierarchical processing to handle documents of any size effectively.

## What Has Been Enhanced ✅

### 1. Semantic Chunking System

- ✅ **Boundary-Aware Splitting**: Paragraph and sentence boundary preservation
- ✅ **Dynamic Chunk Sizing**: Configurable based on model token limits (80% utilization)
- ✅ **Context Overlap**: 10% overlap between chunks maintains narrative flow
- ✅ **Page-Aware Processing**: Tracks page ranges for each chunk (Pages X-Y)

### 2. Hierarchical Summarization

- ✅ **Multi-Stage Processing**: Individual chunk summaries → consolidation → final output
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: 3 concurrent chunks to optimize API usage
- ✅ **Context Preservation**: Detailed chunk summaries maintain local context
- ✅ **Synthesis Logic**: Intelligent consolidation preserves document structure

### 3. Enhanced Token Management

- ✅ **Improved Estimation**: 3.5 chars/token for better accuracy
- ✅ **Dynamic Configuration**: Adapts to different model capabilities
- ✅ **Overhead Calculation**: 500-token prompt overhead accounting
- ✅ **Processing Strategy Selection**: Single-chunk vs multi-chunk based on size

### 4. Progress & User Experience

- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Stage-by-stage progress reporting
- ✅ **Processing Statistics**: Chunks processed, pages analyzed, tokens estimated
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Emojis and clear messaging for each processing stage
- ✅ **Completion Feedback**: Summary generation method and performance stats

### 5. Error Resilience

- ✅ **Chunk-Level Recovery**: Individual chunk failures don't crash entire process
- ✅ **Multi-Tier Fallbacks**: Enhanced → standard → excerpt processing
- ✅ **Detailed Error Reporting**: Actionable error messages with context
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results better than complete failure

## Key Technical Achievements

### Semantic Chunking Architecture

```typescript
interface DocumentChunk {
  content: string;
  index: number;
  startPage: number;
  endPage: number;
  tokens: number;
}

function createSemanticChunks(pdfText: string, config: ChunkingConfig): DocumentChunk[] {
  // Paragraph-aware splitting with context overlap
  const paragraphs = pageContent.split(/\n\s*\n+/);
  // Intelligent boundary detection and chunk creation
}
```

### Hierarchical Processing Pipeline

```typescript
// Stage 1: Individual chunk summarization
const chunkSummaries = await Promise.all(
  chunks.map(chunk => summarizeChunk(chunk, fileName, model, token))
);

// Stage 2: Consolidation and synthesis
const finalSummary = await consolidateSummaries(
  chunkSummaries, fileName, totalPages, model, token
);
```

### Advanced Configuration System

- Dynamic chunk sizing based on model capabilities
- Configurable overlap ratios for context preservation  
- Adaptive processing strategies per document type
- Performance-optimized batch processing

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced Chunking + Post-Refactoring Fixes

Advanced summarization system successfully implemented with comprehensive improvements, followed by critical functionality restoration after lint refactoring:

### Core Features

1. ✅ Semantic chunking with paragraph-aware boundaries
2. ✅ Hierarchical summarization with multi-stage processing
3. ✅ Intelligent overlap strategy (10% default) for context preservation
4. ✅ Batch processing with concurrency control (3 chunks/batch)
5. ✅ Enhanced progress tracking with real-time status updates
6. ✅ Dynamic configuration based on model token limits
7. ✅ Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### Post-Refactoring Fixes

1. ✅ Fixed function naming issues caused by automatic lint fixes
2. ✅ Restored HTML onclick handler functionality
3. ✅ Enhanced webview message handling for better debugging
4. ✅ Added biome-ignore comments to prevent future auto-renaming
5. ✅ Comprehensive code quality (0 lint issues, clean compilation)

## Recent Development Update (July 2025)

### Post-Refactoring Debugging Session

After implementing comprehensive Biome linting (reducing issues from 82 to 0), discovered that the summarize button and text selection functionality had stopped working.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Automatic lint fixes renamed JavaScript functions with underscore prefixes
- HTML onclick handlers couldn't find the renamed functions
- Linter couldn't detect implicit dependencies between HTML and JavaScript

**Functions Affected:**

- `summarizeDocument()` → `_summarizeDocument()`
- `toggleTextSelection()` → `_toggleTextSelection()`
- `toggleDebug()` → `_toggleDebug()`
- `fitToPage()` → `_fitToPage()`

**Resolution Strategy:**

1. **Function Name Restoration:** Reverted all function names to original forms
2. **Lint Suppression:** Added `// biome-ignore lint/correctness/noUnusedVariables: Used by HTML onclick` comments
3. **Enhanced Debugging:** Added console.log statements for troubleshooting
4. **Message Handling:** Improved webview message type handling for text extraction

**Key Learnings:**

- Automated refactoring tools can break implicit cross-file dependencies
- HTML onclick handlers create invisible dependencies that linters can't detect
- Always test functionality after major lint fixes
- Consider using event listeners instead of inline onclick handlers for better maintainability

**Final State:**

- ✅ All functionality restored (summarize button, text selection)
- ✅ Zero lint issues maintained
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Enhanced debugging capabilities for future development
