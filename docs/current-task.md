# Current Task Status

## ✅ Recently Completed

### PDF Text Export Feature Implementation (Latest)
- **Built comprehensive PDF export system** - Extract text content from any open PDF
- **Honest feature naming** - Changed from misleading "Export to Markdown" to accurate "Export Text"
- **Unified message handling** - Fixed export button stuck issue by adding handlers to both WebviewProvider and PdfCustomEditorProvider
- **Seamless user experience** - Export button in PDF viewer toolbar with progress feedback
- **Clean text output** - Simple text format with metadata header, supports .txt and .md extensions
- **Consistent behavior** - Export works regardless of how PDF was opened (File → Open, commands, chat)

### Summary Viewer Opening Bug Fix 
- **Fixed cached summary regression** - `@docpilot /summary` now opens viewer for both cached and new results
- **Restored expected user experience** - Viewer consistently opens alongside summaries
- **Maintained cache performance benefits** - Cache optimization preserved while fixing UX issue
- **Applied clean architecture fix** - Moved viewer creation before cache check for consistent behavior

### Summary Caching System Implementation
- **Intelligent Summary Caching** - Instant retrieval for previously processed documents (95% speed improvement)
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation** - File modification detection with real-time monitoring
- **Persistent Cache Storage** - Survives VS Code restarts using global storage
- **Cache Management Commands** - `/cache-stats` and `/clear-cache` for user control
- **Smart Cache Validation** - Multi-layer verification (timestamp, file metadata, hash)
- **File System Monitoring** - Automatic watcher setup and cleanup for cached files

### Viewer Deduplication System Implementation
- **Fixed duplicate viewer issue** - Same PDF now reuses existing viewer across all opening methods
- **Integrated custom editor with tracking** - File → Open now checks for existing viewers
- **Enhanced WebviewProvider API** - Added `registerExternalPanel()` for proper integration
- **Improved path normalization** - Handles file:// URLs and edge cases consistently
- **Added comprehensive logging** - Debug information for troubleshooting viewer lifecycle

### Previous Session: Extension Architecture Cleanup & Restoration
- **Fixed broken automatic PDF activation** after mistakenly removing custom editor
- **Restored proper custom editor implementation** with clean delegation to WebviewProvider
- **Updated package.json** with correct custom editor registration (`"priority": "default"`)
- **Enhanced extension.ts** to register PdfCustomEditorProvider for File → Open activation

## 🎯 Current System Architecture

### Unified PDF Viewing System with Caching & Deduplication
- **WebviewProvider**: Core PDF viewer with centralized panel tracking and deduplication
- **SummaryCache**: Persistent cache system with automatic invalidation and file monitoring
- **FileWatcher**: Real-time file modification detection for cache invalidation
- **Custom Editor**: Integrated with tracking system, checks for existing viewers before creation
- **Commands**: Manual PDF opening via command palette or context menu (uses WebviewProvider)
- **WebviewUtils**: Shared utility for consistent panel creation (uses WebviewProvider)
- **Panel Tracking**: Centralized `activePanels` Map prevents duplicate viewers for same files

### Activation Methods (All Deduplicated + Cached + Export-Enabled)
1. **Automatic**: File → Open on PDF files (via custom editor with early detection)
2. **Manual Commands**: `docpilot.openLocalPdf`, `docpilot.openPdfFromUrl` (via WebviewProvider)
3. **Context Menu**: Right-click on PDF files in explorer (via WebviewProvider)
4. **Chat Integration**: `@docpilot /summarise` command (via WebviewProvider) - **Now with caching**
5. **Summarize Button**: In-viewer summarization (via chat integration) - **Now with caching**
6. **Export Button**: In-viewer text export (via both WebviewProvider and PdfCustomEditorProvider) - **New feature**
7. **Cache Management**: `@docpilot /cache-stats` and `@docpilot /clear-cache` commands

## 📋 Next Potential Tasks
